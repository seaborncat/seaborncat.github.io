Maybe because of the lockdown I have found myself reading a lot, taking some time out to try new things, to do some coding, learning new words, and I thought what will be the better way to apply those learning than to make a blog-site using Jekyll on GitHub(for the little coding part) and write all my thoughts with the vocab I am building in this free time. 

So here is a small try. Although I am an extremely reticent person I will try to talk about my life, random things that I find exciting or esoteric, reviews on movies/TV-series, and in general "the sh\*t we should care about."
